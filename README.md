# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for a simple Node.js application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the processes of building, testing, containerizing, and deploying the application.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to showcase the automation of the software development lifecycle, including:
- Building and testing a Node.js application.
- Containerizing the application using Docker.
- Deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

### Features
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Dockerized Node.js application.
- Kubernetes deployment with high availability.
- Scalability via Kubernetes replicas.
- Secure management of secrets using GitHub Secrets.

## Folder Structure
 ├── app.js # Node.js application file ├── Dockerfile # Docker configuration file ├── package.json # Node.js dependencies and scripts ├── package-lock.json # Lock file for Node.js dependencies ├── k8s-deployment.yaml # Kubernetes deployment and service configuration ├── .github/ │ └── workflows/ │ └── deploy.yml # GitHub Actions workflow file


## Tools and Technologies
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline automation.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Kubernetes**: For deploying and managing the application.
- **Node.js**: For creating a simple web server.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## How the CI/CD Pipeline Works
1. **Code Push**:
   - The pipeline triggers on a push or pull request to the `main` branch.

2. **Build and Test**:
   - The workflow installs dependencies and runs tests to ensure code quality.

3. **Docker Build and Push**:
   - The Node.js application is built into a Docker image and pushed to Docker Hub.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - The application is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using the `k8s-deployment.yaml` file.

## Deployment Details
### Kubernetes Cluster
- **Deployment**: Ensures two replicas of the application are running.
- **Service**: Exposes the application externally via a LoadBalancer.

### Accessing the Application
The application is available at the public IP or domain name of the Kubernetes service. It responds with "Hello, World!" for HTTP requests.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Managing Docker Hub credentials securely.
  - **Solution**: Used GitHub Secrets to securely store and access credentials during the workflow.
- **Challenge**: Testing Kubernetes deployment locally.
  - **Solution**: Used Minikube for local Kubernetes testing before deploying to the cloud.

## Future Improvements
- Add automated end-to-end testing in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Integrate monitoring and alerting using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Implement Helm charts for better Kubernetes configuration management.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   
2.Install dependencies:
  npm install

3.Run the application:
  node app.js
  -------The application runs on http://localhost:3000------------ 
  
4.Build the Docker image:
  docker build -t my-node-app

5.Run the Docker container:
  docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
